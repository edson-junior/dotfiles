# Dotfiles
If you want to use my dotfiles, first fork this repo, take a look at the code, then edit the files or remove the stuff that you won't be using. This repository is a collection of dotfiles that cater to my needs.

## How to install
- read and run parts of ```setup-machine.sh```
- read and run ```symlink-setup.sh```
